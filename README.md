# "Avoid the Monsters" in Godot 3.5
This video game is my very first full-fledged project, derived from the section "Your First 2D Game" in the
Godot 3.5.3 documentation. _I usually engage in game development as a hobby for myself, to be honest._

Many an element in this project is slightly adjusted, and all of the game code is rewritten in Visual Basic .NET,
which is currently my favorite programming language, even though I'm fond of writing C# scripts as well.

All the classes defined in the VB.NET library are bound to be inherited by empty C# stripts, so that they can be
brought to use in the game. _Nevertheless, as for my game development in Godot in the future, I will be writing
C# scripts for real, with a VB.NET class library still used as a module._

__Last but not least, I have added touch controls in the project. The whole game can be either played on computers
or exported to the Android devices.__
